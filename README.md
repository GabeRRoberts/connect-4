An alternative project I did rather than the provided textbook problems for Chapter 15 of A Modern Approach to C.

game.c is the file that contains main.
Exmaple of a gcc cmd to compile the game: "gcc -o game game.c check.c board.c"

config.h is the place where you can change the size of the board, your preferred characters for each player, and the empty slots for the board.
Deafult values are in place and will work without any changes.
